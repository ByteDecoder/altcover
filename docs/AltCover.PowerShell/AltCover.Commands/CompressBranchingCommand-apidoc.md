# CompressBranchingCommand class

Removes compiler-generated hidden branches from OpenCover.

Takes output from the OpenCover program, and adjust from OpenCover's liberal idea of significant branches towards AltCover's more restricted approach -- chose either or both of `-SameSpan` to unify branches that go from the same start, and take the same trajectory to the same end (OpenCover issue #786 being one instance of this) and `-WithinSequencePoint` to remove branches interior to a statement (compiler generated things like stashing of lambdas, the hidden conditional `Dispose()` after a `using`, or inside F# inlines -- OpenCover issues #657, #807 being instances of this).

Either takes an `XDocument` from the pipeline or from a file; emits the result as an `XDocument` to the pipeline and optionally to a file.

```csharp
    $xml = Compress-Branching -WithinSequencePoint -InputFile "./Tests/Compressible.xml" -OutputFile "./_Packaging/CompressInterior.xml"
```

```csharp
public class CompressBranchingCommand : PSCmdlet
```
