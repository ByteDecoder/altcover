## module `Abstract`
This represents the weakly ("stringly") typed equivalent of the command line options in a C# friendly manner
as interfaces with the values expressed as read-only properties

Refer to the types in C# either as

```
using Altcover;
Abstract.IPrepareOptions prep = ...  or whichever
```
or
```
using static Altcover.Abstract;
IPrepareOptions prep = ... or whichever
```
