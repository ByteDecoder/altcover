Union type defining general command line arguments for `dotnet test` use.
case `Force` indicates a `/AltCoverForce` value
case `FailFast` inicates a `/AltCoverForce` value
case `ShowSummary` indicates a `/AltCoverShowSummary` value
case `Many` indicates a collection of cases

* value `Fast` gives the `/AltCoverFailFast` value this represents
* value `ForceDelete` gives the `/AltCoverForce` value this represents
* value `Summary` gives the `/AltCoverShowSummary` value this represents
