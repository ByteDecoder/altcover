An API for driving coverage instrumentation and collection through the FAKE build system

## Composing the AltCover command line

### Basic elements

Start with one of these

* [`module Abstract`](Abstract-fsapidoc) -- This holds the weakly ("stringly") typed equivalent of the command line options in a C# friendly manner as interfaces with the values expressed as read-only properties.
* [`module Primitive`](Primitive-fsapidoc) -- This holds the weakly ("stringly") typed equivalent of the command line options.
* [`module TypeSafe`](TypeSafe-fsapidoc) -- This holds the strongly-typed equivalent of the command line options.

### The common expression of the command line elements

Make one of these

* [`module AltCover`](AltCover-fsapidoc) -- This represents the AltCover command line options and its validation.

### Use with `dotnet test` 

* [`module DotNet`](DotNet-fsapidoc) -- This represents the further `dotnet test` command line options.
* [`module Fake`](Fake-fsapidoc) -- This is the Fake toolkit integration via extension methods for type `Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions`.

### Use as a command

* [`module AltCoverCommand`](AltCoverCommand-fsapidoc) -- This represents the various `AltCover` operations available, and their execution from a Fake script.
