# namespace AltCover.Fake
```
namespace AltCover.Fake
```
## module `Trace`
```
module Trace =
  val Create: unit -> AltCover.AltCover.LoggingOptions
```
Returns an instance of the core API Logging type that hooks into the `Fake.Core.Trace` facilities

## type `Implementation`
```
[<NoComparison>]
type Implementation =
  | DotNetCore
  | Framework
```
to indicate which command-line executable from the current NuGet package to return

## type `Command`
```
[<Sealed; AbstractClass>]
type Command =
  static member Collect : args:AltCover.Abstract.ICollectOptions * ?log:AltCover.AltCover.LoggingOptions -> int
  static member ImportModule : unit -> string (* returns the `Import-Module` command to use *)
  static member Prepare : args:AltCover.Abstract.IPrepareOptions * ?log:AltCover.AltCover.LoggingOptions -> int
  static member Version : unit -> System.Version
  static member ToolPath : Implementation -> string (* returns the path to the indicated tool *)
```
wraps the core API functions.  If the optional logging argument is not given, then `AltCover.Fake.Trace.Create()` is assumed.

The `int` results are 0 for success and otherwise for failure -- this would be the return code of the operation if run as a command-line function

## Extension methods for type `Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions` (in module `AltCover.Fake.DotNet`)







```
module DotNet =
  type Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions with
```

```
    member WithAltCoverOptions: AltCover.Abstract.IPrepareOptions -> AltCover.Abstract.ICollectOptions ->
                                    AltCover.DotNet.ICLIOptions -> Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions
```








Adds the composed command line options to the `CustomParams` member of the `Common` member
```
    member WithAltCoverImportModule: unit -> Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions
```
Adds `"/p:AltCoverImportModule=true"` to the `CustomParams` member of the `Common` member
```
    member WithAltCoverGetVersion: unit -> Fake.DotNet.DotNet.TestOptions
```
Adds `"/p:AltCoverGetVersion=true"` to the `CustomParams` member of the `Common` member
