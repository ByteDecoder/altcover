# OpenCover.CompressBranching method

Removes compiler-generated hidden branches from OpenCover.

Takes output from the OpenCover program, and adjust from OpenCover's liberal idea of significant branches towards AltCover's more restricted approach -- chose either or both of `sameSpan` to unify branches that go from the same start, and take the same trajectory to the same end (OpenCover issue #786 being one instance of this) and `withinSequencePoint` to remove branches interior to a statement (compiler generated things like stashing of lambdas, the hidden conditional `Dispose()` after a `using`, or inside F# inlines -- OpenCover issues #657, #807 being instances of this).

Either takes an `XDocument` from the pipeline or from a file; emits the result as an `XDocument` to the pipeline and optionally to a file.

```csharp
public static XDocument CompressBranching(XDocument document, bool withinSequencePoint, 
    bool sameSpan)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| document | The input report |
| withinSequencePoint | Whether to hide branches that terminatwe inside the same sequence point as they begin |
| sameSpan | Whether to treat branches between the same points as being the same branch |
