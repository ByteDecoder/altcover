  -r, --recorderDirectory=VALUE
                             The folder containing the instrumented code to
                               monitor (including the AltCover.Recorder.g.dll
                               generated by previous a use of the .net core
                               AltCover).
  -w, --workingDirectory=VALUE
                             Optional: The working directory for the
                               application launch
  -x, --executable=VALUE     The executable to run e.g. dotnet
      --collect              Optional: Process previously saved raw coverage
                               data, rather than launching a process.
  -l, --lcovReport=VALUE     Optional: File for lcov format version of the
                               collected data
  -t, --threshold=VALUE      Optional: one or more of minimum acceptable
                               statement (S), branch (B) or method (M) coverage
                               percentage (integer, 1 to 100) or maximum
                               acceptable CRAP score (C followed by integer, 1
                               to 255) e.g. M80C40B50. If the value starts with
                               a number, a leading S is assumed. If any
                               threshold is specified more than once, the last
                               instance is assumed -- so 25S50 counts as S50.
                               Zero/absent values are ignored. If a coverage
                               result is below threshold, or the CRAP score is
                               above threshold, the return code of the process
                               is the largest abs(threshold - actual) rounded
                               up to the nearest integer.
  -c, --cobertura=VALUE      Optional: File for Cobertura format version of the
                               collected data
  -o, --outputFile=VALUE     Optional: write the recorded coverage to this file
                               rather than overwriting the original report file.
      --dropReturnCode       Optional: Do not report any non-zero return code
                               from a launched process.
      --teamcity[=VALUE]     Optional: Show summary in TeamCity format as well
                               as/instead of the OpenCover summary
  -?, --help, -h             Prints out the options.
