# 1.4-alpha (Araiguma preview releases)
* .net 2.0 support : Building the recorder assembly against .net 2.0 so that it can be used with down-version code as required
* Extended filtering : values are extended from being single substring for matching to a semi-colon separated list of regexes; the only backwards incompatibility will be '.' characters which would need to be escaped.

# 1.0
* Expanded user documentation
* Localizable user messages
* More consistent command line parsing
* [f61f951] BUGFIX Write .mdb out for .mdb in
* All times in UTC for consistency

# 0.8
Single functional change : redefining the -f parameter to work on source files rather than redundantly on assemblies.
Otherwise, procedural changes only:
* Integrating with real-world publishing e.g. NuGet
* Adding many assertable unit tests to the "if it all hangs together, then it passes" operational tests.
* Fixing the bugs thus revealed

# 0.1
Getting the 2010-11 timescale code from a big blob labelled "projects" and into a stand-alone deployable.
